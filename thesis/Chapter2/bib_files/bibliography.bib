abstract = {PURPOSE To review the clinical features and surgical and visual outcomes of pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) as seen in a tertiary referral center. METHODS Retrospective case series spanning 6 years from January 1, 1991 to January 1, 1997. Exclusionary criteria were trauma disrupting the globe and acute retinopathy of prematurity. RESULTS The authors reviewed a series of 29 eyes in 27 pediatric patients (birth to 18 years of age) with RRD. Seventy percent of the patients were male. The mean patient age was 9.6 years. Bilateral RRD was present in 22{\%} of patients; 89{\%} of patients had some form of bilateral ocular pathology at initial presentation. The two most common etiologies (34{\%} each) were myopia and eyes that had undergone surgery for another ocular disorder with subsequent development of RRD. The most common presentation was decreased vision, with a mean duration of 52 days. At presentation, 75{\%} of the affected eyes and 48{\%} of the fellow eyes had visual acuity worse than 20/800. The most common type of retinal break was a horseshoe tear. Late diagnosis was a common problem, evidenced by the frequency of macular detachment (79{\%}) and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (45{\%}) at initial presentation. The most common primary repair was a scleral buckle. Anatomic reattachment was ultimately accomplished in 72{\%} of cases with a mean of 2.2 surgeries per eye. Average postoperative follow-up time was 21.4 months (range 4 to 61 months). At final follow-up, 41{\%} of the affected eyes had visual acuity 20/800 or better. Thirty-eight percent of the affected eyes had a final visual acuity better than or equal to the fellow eye. CONCLUSION In this series, pediatric RRD occurred most commonly in association with myopia (Stickler's syndrome and adolescent retinopathy of prematurity) and prior intraocular surgery. Most eyes were anatomically reattached after multiple surgeries. Forty-one percent of eyes retained vision of 20/800 or better. Preserving vision in children with RRD is of great importance, particularly given the 89{\%} frequency of vision-threatening abnormalities in fellow eyes.},

abstract = {Aims—To investigate the ultrastructure of the vitreoretinal interface following plasmin induced posterior vitreous detachment. Methods—Plasmin (1 or 2 U/0.1 ml) was injected into the vitreous cavity of 24 eyes of freshly slaughtered pigs. The 24 fellow eyes received calcium-free and magnesium-free PBS and served as a control. After incubation at 37°C for 30 and 60 minutes, the globes were placed in fixative and hemisected. Specimens for light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy were obtained from the poste-rior pole, the equator, and the vitreous base using a corneal trephine. Results—All plasmin treated eyes showed posterior vitreous detachment. However, the inner limiting membrane (ILM) was covered by remnants of cortical vitreous at the posterior pole and at the equator. There was a direct correlation between the con-centration and exposure times of plasmin and the degree of vitreoretinal separation. Eyes exposed to 1 U plasmin for 30 minutes had a dense network of residual collagen fibrils while those exposed to 1 U plasmin for 60 minutes had only sparse collagen fibrils covering the ILM. Eyes treated with 2 U plasmin for 60 minutes had a smooth retinal surface, consistent with a bare ILM. At the vitreous base there was no vitre-oretinal separation. In all control eyes the vitreous cortex was completely attached to the retina. There was no evidence of retinal damage in any plasmin treated eye. Conclusion—Plasmin induces a cleavage between the vitreous cortex and the ILM without morphological changes to the retina. In contrast with previous reports, plasmin produces a smooth retinal sur-face and additional surgery is not re-quired in this experimental setting. The degree of vitreoretinal separation depends on the concentration and length of expo-sure to plasmin.},

The most common type is rhegmatogenous, which results from retinal breaks caused by vitreoretinal traction. Risk factors for retinal detachment include advancing age, previous cataract surgery, myopia, and trauma. Patients typically will present with symptoms such as light flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, and blurred vision. Early intervention facilitates prevention of retinal detachment after formation of retinal breaks and improves visual outcomes of retinal detachment surgery.

The annual incidences (per 100,000 population) of four types of detachment were determined: nontraumatic phakic (6.1), traumatic phakic (1.0), nontraumatic aphakic (4.9), and traumatic aphakic (0.4). The incidences of nontraumatic phakic detachment for men and women were similar, although there was a preponderance of women that reflected their greater representation in the general population. The proportions of men were significantly higher in traumatic detachments compared with nontraumatic detachments. Men tended to be younger than women for all types of detachment; however, only in nontraumatic aphakic detachment was there a significant difference between mean ages. There was an insignificant preponderance of right eye involvement in all four detachment groups.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is a form of abuse in which an infant, typically 6 months or less, is held and submitted to repeated acceleration-deceleration forces. One of the indicators of abuse is bilateral retinal hemorrhaging. A computational model of an infant eye, using the finite element method, is built in order to assess forces at the posterior retina for a shaking and an impact motions. METHOD The eye model is based on histological studies, diagrams, and materials from previous literature. Motions are applied to the model to simulate a four-cycle shaking motion in 1 second with maximum extension/flexion of the neck. The retinal forces of the shaking motion, at the posterior eye, are compared to an impact pulse (60G) simulating a fall for a total duration of 100 ms. RESULTS The shaking motion, for the first cycle, shows retinal force means at the posterior eye to be around 0.08 N sustained from the time range of 50 to 200 ms, into the shake, with a peak in excess of 0.2 N. The impulse, area under the curve, is 15 N-ms for 250 msec for the first cycle. The impact simulation reveals a mean retinal force around 0.025 N for a time range of 0 to 26 ms, with a peak force around 0.11 N. Moreover, the impulse for the impact simulation is 13 times lower than the shaking motion. CONCLUSION The results suggest that shaking alone may be enough to cause retinal hemorrhaging, as there are more sustained and higher forces in the posterior retina, compared to an impact due to a fall. This is in part due to the optic nerve causing more localized stresses in a shaking motion than an impact.},

@article{Johnson_2010,
abstract = {Purpose: To summarize emerging concepts regarding the onset and progression, traction effects, and complications of the early stages of age-related posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Design: Interpretive essay. Methods: Review and synthesis of selected literature, with clinical illustrations, interpretation, and perspective. Results: Imaging of the vitreoretinal interface with optical coherence tomography has shown that PVD begins in the perifoveal macula. Recent longitudinal studies have demonstrated conclusively that early PVD stages persist chronically and progress slowly over months to years. Vitreous traction forces resulting from perifoveal PVD with a small vitreofoveolar adhesion (500 $\mu$m or less) may cause localized cystoid foveal thickening or one of several macular hole conditions. Traction associated with larger adhesion zones may cause or exacerbate a separate group of macular disorders. Ultrastructural studies suggest that epiretinal membrane develops from cortical vitreous remnants left on the retinal surface after PVD and plays an important role in traction vitreomaculopathies. Conclusions: Age-related PVD is an insidious, chronic event that begins in the perifoveal macula and evolves over a prolonged period before vitreopapillary separation. Although asymptomatic in most individuals, its early stages may be complicated by a variety of macular and optic disc pathologic features, determined in part by the size and strength of the residual vitreoretinal adhesion. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

@article{LeGoff_2008,
abstract = {This review will focus on the molecular organisation of the adult vitreous and how it undergoes ageing changes throughout life that result in vitreous liquefaction and a predisposition towards posterior vitreous detachment and retinal break formation. At birth, the vitreous humour is in a gel state due to the presence of a network of fine collagen fibrils. With ageing, these collagen fibrils progressively aggregate due to a loss of type IX collagen from their surfaces. The aggregation of collagen fibrils may cause vitreous liquefaction which, when combined with an age-related weakening of postbasal vitreoretinal adhesion, predisposes to posterior vitreous detachment. Throughout postnatal life, the posterior border of the vitreous base migrates posteriorly from the ora serrata into the peripheral retina. This is due to new collagen synthesis by the peripheral retina. This new collagen intertwines with pre-existing cortical vitreous collagen to create new adhesions and thereby extends the vitreous base posteriorly. If irregularities in the posterior border of the vitreous base arise from this process, there is a predisposition towards retinal break formation during posterior vitreous detachment and subsequent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.},

abstract = {The internal limiting membrane (ILM) and cortical vitreous of the rabbit and primate were studied with transmission electron microscopy following staining with the cationic dye, Alcian blue GX. An unusual feature of the cortical vitreal collagen fibril was its displacement from the ILM: it did not insert into the lamina densa. The separation between vitreal collagen and the ILM was especially noticeable in the rabbit eye, which possessed an extremely strong vitreal retinal attachment in the posterior fundus. The lack of fibril insertion was observed in rabbit tissue that had been fixed by quick freezing on a helium-cooled copper block. The similarity in the appearance of tissue fixed by glutar- aldehyde, glutaraldehyde supplemented with Alcian blue, or by quick freezing suggested that the lack of collagen fibril insertion into the ILM was an accurate representation of the relationship between collagen and the ILM. It was found that these two animal species had radically different ILM's; the rabbit ILM was a thin basement membrane throughout all areas of the posterior fundus, whereas the ILM of the cynomolgus monkey was a thick basement membrane in the peripapillary region and a thin basement membrane in the region of the fovea centralis. The topographic variations in the primate ILM thickness and appearance followed the pattern observed in human eyes. Like man, the thickening of the cynomolgus ILM in the posterior fundus was age related. The similarity between the cynomolgus and human ILM suggests that this animal would be more suitable than the rabbit for studying age- related changes or alterations in the strength of vitreal attachment following trauma.

abstract = {AIMS/BACKGROUND Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a potentially blinding condition. Obtaining an accurate estimate of RRD incidence in the population is essential in understanding the healthcare burden related to this disorder. METHODS A systematic review of all population-based epidemiology studies of RRD published between January 1970 and January 2009 from Medline database searches was performed. RESULTS RRD incidence demonstrates significant geographical variation and its incidence has been reported to be between 6.3 and 17.9 per 100,000 population. For studies with a sample size {\textgreater}300 the median annual incidence per 100,000 population was 10.5 (IQR 8.1-13.2) and the mean proportion of bilateral RRD was 7.26{\%}. Overall, the mean prevalence of lattice degeneration was 45.7+/-20.3{\%} and myopia was 47.28+/-12.59{\%}. CONCLUSIONS Estimates of RRD incidence have varied threefold, but inclusion criteria and other design features have differed across studies making direct comparisons difficult. The overall incidence of RRD is not yet well established: more incidence studies of adequate methodology are needed to explore temporal changes in incidence. RRD incidence varies with ethnicity and is strongly associated with increasing age, myopia and certain vitreo-retinal degenerations. Due to changes in cataract surgery trends, the proportion of pseudophakic RRD presenting to specialised centres appears to be increasing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The pathogenesis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is complex, and our knowledge of the exact mechanism of vitreoretinal attachment and detachment remains incomplete. METHODS We performed a Medline, Ovid, and EMBASE search using search words rhegmatogenous, retinal detachment, vitreous, and retinal adhesion. All appropriate articles were reviewed, and the evidence was compiled. RESULTS Cortical vitreous contains fibrillar collagens type II, V/XI, and IX. The inner limiting membrane of the retina contains collagens type I, IV, VI, and XVIII as well as numerous other glycoproteins and potential adhesion molecules. The distribution and age-related changes in the structure of these molecules play an important role in the formation of a retinal break, which may compromise and disrupt the normal mechanisms of neurosensory retinal adhesion. CONCLUSION Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment development is intimately related to changes in the fibrillar structure of the aging vitreous culminating in posterior vitreous detachment with regions of persistent and tangential vitreoretinal traction predisposing to retinal tear formation. A complex interplay of factors such as weakening of vitreoretinal adhesion, posterior migration of the vitreous base, and molecular changes at the vitreoretinal interface are important in predisposing to focal areas of vitreoretinal traction precipitating rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Once formed, the passage of liquefied vitreous through a retinal break may overwhelm normal neurosensory-retinal pigment epithelium adhesion perpetuating and extending detachment and causing visual loss. To understand the molecular events underlying rhegmatogenous retinal detachment so that new therapies can be developed, it is important to appreciate the structural organization of the vitreous, the biology underlying vitreous liquefaction and posterior vitreous detachment, and the mechanisms of vitreoretinal attachment and detachment.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To develop a finite element analysis of the eye and orbit that can be subjected to virtual shaking forces. METHODS LS-DYNA computer software was used to design a finite element model of the human infant eye, including orbit, fat, sclera, retina, vitreous, and muscles. The orbit was modeled as a rigid solid; the sclera and retina as elastic shells; the vitreous as viscoelastic solid or Newtonian fluid; and fat as elastic or viscoelastic solid. Muscles were modeled as spring-damper systems. Orbit-fat, fat-sclera, sclera-retina, and vitreous nodes-retina interfaces were defined with the use of the tied surface-surface function in LS-DYNA. The model was subjected to angular acceleration pulses obtained from shaking tests of a biofidelic doll (Aprica 2.5 kg dummy). Parametric studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of varying the material properties of vitreous/fat on maximum stress and stress distribution. RESULTS With the vitreous modeled as a Newtonian fluid, the repeated acceleration-deceleration oscillatory motion characteristic of abusive head trauma (AHT) causes cumulative increases in the forces experienced at the vitreoretinal interface. Under these vitreous conditions, retinal stress maximums occur at the posterior pole and peripheral retina, where AHT retinal hemorrhage is most often found. CONCLUSIONS Our model offers an improvement on dummy and animal models in allowing analysis of the effect of shaking on ocular tissues. It can be used under certain material conditions to demonstrate progressive “stacking” of intraocular stresses in locations corresponding to typical AHT injury patterns, allowing a better understanding of the mechanisms of retinal hemorrhage patterns.},

History of retinal detachment was found in 13 cases (0.028{\%}); 61.5{\%} of these had traumatic retinal detachment, and 23.1{\%} had high myopia without history of trauma. The age-related annual incidence of retinal detachment in patients aged ten to 19 years was calculated to be 2.9 per 100,000. The prevalence among the males was 3.7 per 10,000 and among the females 1.6 per 10,000. The difference between the sexes was not statistically significant.},

abstract = {Vitreomacular traction resulting from lacking, incomplete or anomalous pos- terior vitreous detachment is suspected to play a crucial role in the pathogene- sis of different forms of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) along with the known mechanisms. It is probable that the fundamental pathomechanisms of AMD formation have already begun by the time tractional forces lead to a change for the worse. Vitreomacular traction alone is perhaps not able to induce AMD. It would seem sensible to consider vitreous changes when diag- nosing and treating AMD patients because of the high coincidence of vitre- omacular traction and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and the often successful treatment of other diseases of the vitreoretinal interface by vitrec- tomy. The concept of the pathogenesis of AMD should therefore be extended to include the influence of the vitreous, especially where therapeutic concepts such as pharmacological vitreolysis and vitreous separation have been estab- lished as causative treatment of late forms of AMD.},

abstract = {Age-related differences in vitreoretinal adhesion were investigated in 59 human eyes from donors aged from 33 weeks of gestation to 94 years with the use of dark-field and electron microscopy of whole vitreous. In all eyes from individuals aged 21 years or older, dissection of the retina off the vitreous resulted in cleavage between the vitreous cortex and the internal limiting lamina. However, in six (40{\%}) of 15 eyes from individuals aged 20 years or younger, the internal limiting lamina remained adherent to the vitreous cortex in an area that encompassed the macula, temporal arcades, and peripapillary posterior pole. Ultrastructural studies revealed inner portions of M{\"{u}}ller's cells that were attached to the posterior aspect of the internal limiting lamina. These results suggested that, in youth, there is adhesion between the vitreous cortex and internal limiting lamina that is stronger than M{\"{u}}ller's cell itself and is topographically more extensive than previously thought.},

@article{Uchio_1999,
abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS A simulation model of the human eye was developed. It was applied to the determination of the physical and mechanical conditions of impacting foreign bodies causing intraocular foreign body (IOFB) injuries. METHODS Modules of the Hypermesh (Altair Engineering, Tokyo, Japan) were used for solid modelling, geometric construction, and finite element mesh creation based on information obtained from cadaver eyes. The simulations were solved by a supercomputer using the finite element analysis (FEA) program PAM-CRASH (Nihon ESI, Tokyo, Japan). It was assumed that rupture occurs at a strain of 18.0{\%} in the cornea and 6.8{\%} in the sclera and at a stress of 9.4 MPa for both cornea and sclera. Blunt-shaped missiles were shot and set to impact on the surface of the cornea or sclera at velocities of 30 and 60 m/s, respectively. RESULTS According to the simulation, the sizes of missile above which corneal rupture occurred at velocities of 30 and 60 m/s were 1.95 and 0.82 mm. The missile sizes causing scleral rupture were 0.95 and 0.75 mm at velocities of 30 and 60 m/s. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that this FEA model has potential usefulness as a simulation tool for ocular injury and it may provide useful information for developing protective measures against industrial and traffic ocular injuries.},

@article{Yoshida_2014,
abstract = {We aimed to elucidate the mechanism of the retinal hemorrhage (RH) accompanied by shaken baby syndrome or abusive head trauma (SBS/AHT) by analyses using a computational model. We focused on a hypothesis that the vitreoretinal traction due to acceleration and deceleration caused by abusive shaking leads to retinal hemorrhage. A finite element (FE) mechanical model with simple spherical geometry was constructed. When the FE mechanical model was virtually shaken, the intensity of the stress applied to the retinal plane agreed well with the results from an analysis using a physical model made of agar gel. Impacts due to falling events induced more intensive tensile stresses, but with shorter duration, than the shake did. By applying a mathematical theory on tackiness, we propose a hypothesis that the time integration of the stress, in the unit of Pa{\textperiodcentered}s, would be a good predictor of the RH accompanied by SBS/AHT. A single cycle of abusive shake amounted to 101Pa{\textperiodcentered}s of time integration of inflicted stress, while a single impact event amounted to 36Pa{\textperiodcentered}s. This would explain the paradoxical observation that shaking induces RH while RH due to impact events is only seen in a major event such as a fatal motor vehicle accident.},

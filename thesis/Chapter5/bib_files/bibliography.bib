abstract = {Publisher Summary The chapter presents the mechanics of the peel test by applying a continuum fracture-mechanics method using an energy balance approach. The peel test is an attractive test method to assess the performance of a wide range of flexible laminates and adhesive joints. However, although it is a relatively simple test to undertake, it is often a complex test to analyze and thus obtain a characteristic measure of the toughness of the laminate or adhesive joint. The theoretical methods, via both analytical and numerical techniques, which have been reported to ascertain values of the adhesive fracture energy, Gc is discussed in the chapter. The current challenge is to accurately model any extensive plastic deformation which may occur in the flexible peeling arm, because if this is not accurately modeled then the value of Gc deduced may suffer a high degree of error. The chapter reviews the latest developments in the analytical and numerical approaches and describes the use of cohesive zone models. The use of these approaches to interpret experimental data from peel tests is also considered in the chapter.},

abstract = {In this review, the authors present special considerations a vitreoretinal surgeon should take into account before embarking on surgery in a pediatric eye. First, the anatomy of a pediatric eye is different from an adult and changes as the child grows. This is important especially in relation to the placement of transconjunctival ports. The structural characteristics of the sclera are also different, with lower scleral rigidity found in pediatric eyes. When considering vitrectomy, a posterior pars plicata lens-sparing technique should be considered. However, this may not be possible in complicated total detachments where anterior translimbal vitrectomy may be the method of choice. Scleral buckles are preferred for certain cases, and division of the encirclage is advocated in children below the age of 2 years, once the retina has stabilized. Enzymatic vitreolysis has been described as a preoperative adjunct to enhance complete detachment of the posterior hyaloid and reduce iatrogenic retinal breaks. However, its use in pediatric eyes has been limited, and larger studies are warranted. Finally, postoperative visual rehabilitation and treatment of amblyopia are key to maximizing functional outcomes in the pediatric patient. Co-management with a pediatric ophthalmologist and enlisting the co-operation of the parents are essential.},

abstract = {PURPOSE. Vitrectomy is associated with the rapid progression of nuclear cataracts. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that age-related liquefaction of the vitreous gel may also be associated with lens opacification. METHODS. Lenses from eye bank eyes were graded for nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular opacities, and the amount of liquid vitreous was measured. RESULTS. Nuclear sclerosis (NS) grade, percent liquefaction, and age all correlated highly (P {\textless} 0.0001). After adjustment was made for age, the correlation between NS and percent liquefaction was 0.37 (P {\textless} 0.0001), and the correlation between age and NS after adjustment for liquefaction was 0.57 (P {\textless} 0.0001). After the eyes were stratified into age groups, the correlation between NS and percent liquefaction was found to be highest in eyes from donors aged 51 to 70. Cortical and posterior subcapsular opacities increased with age, but scores for these cataract types did not significantly correlate with vitreous liquefaction. CONCLUSIONS. Loss of vitreous gel during aging increases the risk of nuclear cataracts. Preservation or replacement of the vitreous gel may protect patients from nuclear cataract.},

abstract = {Patients with retinal detachment often present to their general practitioner, emergency department, or optometrist after central vision has been compromised. This delay is unfortunate because early repair results in little or no visual loss. Once the detachment extends across the fovea (the central macula), permanent visual impairment is almost inevitable. Thorough examination of the retina needs equipment that is rarely available to non-ophthalmologists. Recognition of symptoms and awareness of the risk factors for retinal detachment may help in making speedy referrals and saving vision. {\#}{\#}{\#}{\#} Methods For an overview in the current management of retinal detachment we consulted textbooks and proceedings of meetings in the field of retinal surgery. We searched Medline and Cochrane Review databases for “retinal detachment”, “retinal break”, “retinal tear”, “retinal hole”, “vitreous detachment”, “lattice”, “retinal tuft”, “vitrectomy”, “scleral buckle”, and “retinopexy”, and we searched the internet for reviews and perspectives on retinal detachment. Retinal detachment is separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (fig 1)⇓. In health, the potential “subretinal space” between these two layers is closed by the retinal pigment epithelium actively pumping fluid across the retina and into the choroid.1 Cellular interdigitation and extracellular matrix provide additional adhesion. Retinal detachment occurs when the forces of retinal attachment are overcome and fluid accumulates in the subretinal space. Fig 1 The retina lines the internal surface of the posterior two thirds of the globe. It is thickest around the optic nerve and ends at the ora serrata, 5-7 mm behind the limbus. The macula lies temporal to the optic nerve, bordered by the vascular arcades; the fovea is a depression at its centre that provides fine visual acuity. The outermost layer of the retina contains photoreceptors (rods and cones), loosely attached to the retinal pigment epithelium; they depend on the retinal {\ldots}},

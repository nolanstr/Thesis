abstract = {Background: Posterior vitreous detachment is known to develop early in high myopia. However, the prevalence of posterior vitreous detachment in relation to patient age and degree of myopia has not been studied by modern vitreous examination methods. Methods: The vitreous conditions of 224 eyes with high myopia ({\textgreater}-6 diopters [D]) were examined biomicroscopically with a +90-D preset lens and a Goldmann threemirror contact lens. The vitreous conditions of 220 eyes with emmetropia (between −1 and +1 D) also were studied and served as controls. Results: In high myopia, no patients 29 years of age or younger had posterior vitreous detachment. Thereafter, the prevalence of posterior vitreous detachment increased with age (i.e., 23{\%}, 29{\%}, 44{\%}, and 72{\%} in the fourth through seventh decades, respectively, and 100{\%} of patients 70 years or older). Moreover, posterior vitreous detachment developed earlier in severe high myopia ({\textgreater}−10 D) than in moderate high myopia ({\textgreater}−6 to −10 D). In emmetropia, no patients 39 years of age or younger had posterior vitreous detachment, and its prevalence also increased with age (i.e., 8{\%}, 23{\%}, 44{\%}, 74{\%}, and 86{\%} in the fifth through ninth decades, respectively). Conclusion: In high myopia, posterior vitreous detachment develops increasingly with age and degree of myopia. Although the sample size in each age group was small, the results suggested that posterior vitreous detachment may develop nearly 10 years earlier in highly myopic than in emmetropic eyes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether aging vitreous collagen fibrils undergo ultrastructural changes that might underlie vitreous liquefaction and posterior vitreous detachment. METHODS: Vitreous collagen fibrils from 21 human subjects (age range, 3-89 years) and from bovine eyes were isolated on electron microscopy grids. Cupromeronic blue labeling in the presence of 0.3 M MgCl(2) and immunogold labeling for collagen types II and IX were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Aging was associated with marked changes on the surface of human vitreous collagen fibrils, including an exponential loss of type IX collagen along with its chondroitin sulfate side-chains (half-life, 11 years) and a fourfold increase in the exposure of type II collagen. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being a minor component of vitreous collagen fibrils, type IX collagen, probably by virtue of its chondroitin sulfate side-chains, shields type II collagen from exposure on the fibril surface. With aging, this shielding diminishes, resulting in the surface exposure of "sticky" type II collagen and thus predisposing the vitreous collagen fibrils to fusion. These changes could underlie vitreous liquefaction and weakening of vitreoretinal adhesion.},

Also, the retina was more adherent in pigmented than in albino fundi. No significant difference was found between eyes from male and female rabbits or between right eyes and left eyes.

We have developed a new in vitro method for measuring retinal adhesiveness in the rabbit that is faster than previous models, and can monitor changes sooner after enucleation. We used the percentage of retina which retained pigment after peeling from the RPE as a quantitative measure of retinal adhesiveness. We found that the failure of adhesion after death is more rapid and severe than previously reported, but can be inhibited by cold temperature. Pigment adherence was also modified by ionic and metabolic factors that have been found to affect other indices of adhesion. These results emphasize the limitations of in vitro data relative to the physiologic forces that maintain retinal adhesion in vivo.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To review the clinical features and surgical and visual outcomes of pediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) as seen in a tertiary referral center. METHODS Retrospective case series spanning 6 years from January 1, 1991 to January 1, 1997. Exclusionary criteria were trauma disrupting the globe and acute retinopathy of prematurity. RESULTS The authors reviewed a series of 29 eyes in 27 pediatric patients (birth to 18 years of age) with RRD. Seventy percent of the patients were male. The mean patient age was 9.6 years. Bilateral RRD was present in 22{\%} of patients; 89{\%} of patients had some form of bilateral ocular pathology at initial presentation. The two most common etiologies (34{\%} each) were myopia and eyes that had undergone surgery for another ocular disorder with subsequent development of RRD. The most common presentation was decreased vision, with a mean duration of 52 days. At presentation, 75{\%} of the affected eyes and 48{\%} of the fellow eyes had visual acuity worse than 20/800. The most common type of retinal break was a horseshoe tear. Late diagnosis was a common problem, evidenced by the frequency of macular detachment (79{\%}) and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (45{\%}) at initial presentation. The most common primary repair was a scleral buckle. Anatomic reattachment was ultimately accomplished in 72{\%} of cases with a mean of 2.2 surgeries per eye. Average postoperative follow-up time was 21.4 months (range 4 to 61 months). At final follow-up, 41{\%} of the affected eyes had visual acuity 20/800 or better. Thirty-eight percent of the affected eyes had a final visual acuity better than or equal to the fellow eye. CONCLUSION In this series, pediatric RRD occurred most commonly in association with myopia (Stickler's syndrome and adolescent retinopathy of prematurity) and prior intraocular surgery. Most eyes were anatomically reattached after multiple surgeries. Forty-one percent of eyes retained vision of 20/800 or better. Preserving vision in children with RRD is of great importance, particularly given the 89{\%} frequency of vision-threatening abnormalities in fellow eyes.},

abstract = {Aims—To investigate the ultrastructure of the vitreoretinal interface following plasmin induced posterior vitreous detachment. Methods—Plasmin (1 or 2 U/0.1 ml) was injected into the vitreous cavity of 24 eyes of freshly slaughtered pigs. The 24 fellow eyes received calcium-free and magnesium-free PBS and served as a control. After incubation at 37°C for 30 and 60 minutes, the globes were placed in fixative and hemisected. Specimens for light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy were obtained from the poste-rior pole, the equator, and the vitreous base using a corneal trephine. Results—All plasmin treated eyes showed posterior vitreous detachment. However, the inner limiting membrane (ILM) was covered by remnants of cortical vitreous at the posterior pole and at the equator. There was a direct correlation between the con-centration and exposure times of plasmin and the degree of vitreoretinal separation. Eyes exposed to 1 U plasmin for 30 minutes had a dense network of residual collagen fibrils while those exposed to 1 U plasmin for 60 minutes had only sparse collagen fibrils covering the ILM. Eyes treated with 2 U plasmin for 60 minutes had a smooth retinal surface, consistent with a bare ILM. At the vitreous base there was no vitre-oretinal separation. In all control eyes the vitreous cortex was completely attached to the retina. There was no evidence of retinal damage in any plasmin treated eye. Conclusion—Plasmin induces a cleavage between the vitreous cortex and the ILM without morphological changes to the retina. In contrast with previous reports, plasmin produces a smooth retinal sur-face and additional surgery is not re-quired in this experimental setting. The degree of vitreoretinal separation depends on the concentration and length of expo-sure to plasmin.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects.

abstract = {A method for examining retinal adhesion in vitro is described. Retinal detachment is produced experimentally by injecting Ringer's solution from a micropipette into the retinal pigment epithelial interface. The resulting detachment is a round blister, demonstrating equal retinal adhesion and elasticity in all directions under physiologic conditions. Measurement of hydrostatic pressure in the experimental detachment allowed postmortem changes to be followed up. Normal adhesion was found up to ten minutes after enucleation. Reduced adhesion was evident more than 15 minutes following enucleation; after 25 minutes, adhesion was so poor that blisters could no longer be formed. The loss of retinal adhesion seems to result from the exhaustion of metabolic substrates in the isolated tissue. Local alterations in adhesion, as after photocoagulation, can be detected as characteristic changes in the shape of experimental detachment and indicates enhanced, diminished, or unchanged adhesion. The present method, thus, defines normal conditions, identifies degenerative and artifactual changes, and permits localized changes in adhesion to be differentiated.},

This article presents both classifications of a PVD by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and of a shallow PVD by optical coherence tomography (OCT). By biomicroscopy, the vitreous condition is determined based on the presence or absence of a PVD. The PVD then is classified as either a complete posterior vitreous detachment (C-PVD) or a partial posterior vitreous detachment (P-PVD). A C-PVD is further divided into a C-PVD with collapse and a C-PVD without collapse, while a P-PVD is divided into a P-PVD with shrinkage of the posterior hyaloid membrane (P-PVD with shrinkage) and a P-PVD without shrinkage of the posterior hyaloid membrane (P-PVD without shrinkage). A P-PVD without shrinkage has a subtype characterized by vitreous gel attachment through the premacular hole in a posterior hyaloid membrane to the macula (P-PVD without shrinkage [M]). By OCT, a shallow PVD is classified as the absence of a shallow PVD or as a shallow PVD. A shallow PVD is then subclassified as a shallow PVD without shrinkage of the posterior vitreous cortex, a shallow PVD with shrinkage of the posterior vitreous cortex, and a peripheral shallow PVD. A shallow PVD without shrinkage of the posterior vitreous cortex has two subtypes: an age-related shallow PVD and a perifoveal PVD associated with a macular hole.},

abstract = {Small retinal detachments (blebs) were made in living eyes by injecting balanced salt solution into the subretinal space with a micropipette. A second micropipette, inserted into the same bleb, measured subretinal pressure using a resistance servonulling system. The adhesive force was calculated from the pressure difference across the retina according to Laplace's law. The retinal adhesive force in rabbit, cat, and monkey eyes averaged 1.0, 1.8, and 1.4 x 10(2) dyne/cm, respectively. In rabbit eyes, 2 hr after intravenous administration of 15 mg/kg acetazolamide, the retinal adhesive force was increased to 133{\%}. In monkeys, this dose of acetazolamide increased retinal adhesion to 144{\%} of control values. Mannitol (2 g/kg) increased retinal adhesion in the monkey to 153{\%} of control values 90 min after intravenous injection (compared with an increase of 145{\%} in previous experiments in the rabbit). Because both mannitol and acetazolamide enhance retinal adhesiveness in living primate eyes, it seems likely that they will have a similar effect in humans that they may be clinically useful.},

abstract = {A new method to evaluate the retinal adhesive force, which was defined as the force needed to achieve adhesive failure per unit length, in the in vivo rabbit eye was tested. A small dome-shaped retinal detachment (bleb) was made in the posterior pole by injecting balanced salt solution into the subretinal space. A separate measuring micropipette with a tip diameter of 5 microns was inserted into the subretinal space. The subretinal pressure was measured directly with the resistance servonulling method as the solution was injected repeatedly into the subretinal space. According to Laplace's law, the retinal adhesive force per unit length in normal Dutch rabbits was calculated to be (1.8 +/- 0.2) X 10(2) dyn/cm (n = 87). This value was about five times larger than that reported previously with in vitro peeling methods. The new method will resolve several problems encountered in the previous methods and will allow for the measurement of the retinal adhesive force more physiologically and precisely.},

abstract = {Sheep have many advantages to study neurogenesis in comparison to the well-known rodent models. Their development and life expectancy are relatively long and they possess a gyrencephalic brain. Sheep are also seasonal breeders, a characteristic that allows studying the involvement of hypothalamic neurogenesis in the control of seasonal reproduction. Sheep are also able to individually recognize their conspecifics and develop selective and lasting bonds. Adult olfactory neurogenesis could be adapted to social behavior by supporting recognition of conspecifics. The present review reveals the distinctive features of the hippocampal, olfactory, and hypothalamic neurogenesis in sheep. In particular, the organization of the subventricular zone and the dynamic of neuronal maturation differs from that of rodents. In addition, we show that various physiological conditions, such as seasonal reproduction, gestation, and lactation differently modulate these three neurogenic niches. Last, we discuss recent evidence indicating that hypothalamic neurogenesis acts as an important regulator of the seasonal control of reproduction and that olfactory neurogenesis could be involved in odor processing in the context of maternal behavior.},

abstract = {Tumor cells traverse basement membranes (BM) during the stages of the metastatic process. Penetration of the BM may involve proteolysis by enzymes directly or indirectly associated with tumor cells. This study evaluated the role of the serine proteases urokinase (plasminogen activator), plasmin, and another regulatory protease, $\alpha$-thrombin, in the degradation of the BM. Homogeneously pure enzyme preparations were incubated with isolated components of BM and with whole human amnion BM. The BM components consisted of acid-extracted type IV collagen, pepsin fragments of collagen type IV, laminin, and fibronectin. Collagen type V ($\alpha$A$\alpha$B) associated with the peri-BM zone was also studied. The purity of the enzymes was verified by gel electrophoresis and inhibitor studies. Digestion of the BM components was performed at 25° using matched activity for the different enzymes. Urokinase failed to significantly degrade fibronectin or any of the other BM components. Under the same 25° (native) conditions, plasmin and thrombin cleaved fibronectin and laminin into multiple specific fragments but did not produce a major cleavage of acid-extracted type IV collagen, pepsinized type IV collagen, or $\alpha$A$\alpha$B (type V) collagen. $\alpha$-Thrombin selectively degraded only the m.w. 400,000 chain of laminin, whereas plasmin degraded both of the laminin chains. Digestion of laminin by the serine proteases was time and concentration dependent, as verified by a new degradation assay using [14C]laminin. A variety of normal and neoplastic cells were tested for the presence of laminin-degrading proteases. Macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and metastatic tumor cells contained a significant laminin-degrading activity. The activity was enhanced by the addition of plasminogen. Type V collagen was cleaved by thrombin and plasmin at 35° but not at temperatures below 33°. Following treatment of whole-amnion BM with any of these enzymes, electron microscopy demonstrated preservation of the lamina densa. Immunohistology studies indicated that laminin, but not type IV collagen, was removed from the whole BM by plasmin treatment. The results suggest that these BM components are poor substrates for plasminogen activators and that plasmin alone is not sufficient to completely degrade the whole BM. Plasmin, generated through the action of plasminogen activator, may play a significant role in the degradation of noncollagenous components of the BM.},

abstract = {Retinal adhesion and the resorption of subretinal fluid were studied in Dutch rabbits, with two experimental techniques. In the first, small local detachments were made in vivo by injecting a small amount of fluid under the retina with a micropipette, and the time for resorption of the detachment was monitored. In the second, strips of eyecup were maintained in a physiologic bathing medium, and the force required to peel retina from the pigment epithelium was measured. Using these techniques, we have found that both the mechanisms for removing subretinal fluid and for maintaining retinal adhesion in vitro are enhanced by exposure to ouabain, are inhibited by exposure to cyanide, and are inhibited by the replacement of the physiologic medium with normal saline. These data suggest that metabolic systems may simultaneously hydrate and dehydrate the subretinal space and that some factors which are important to the maintenance of normal adhesion are missing from normal saline.},

abstract = {AIMS/BACKGROUND Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a potentially blinding condition. Obtaining an accurate estimate of RRD incidence in the population is essential in understanding the healthcare burden related to this disorder. METHODS A systematic review of all population-based epidemiology studies of RRD published between January 1970 and January 2009 from Medline database searches was performed. RESULTS RRD incidence demonstrates significant geographical variation and its incidence has been reported to be between 6.3 and 17.9 per 100,000 population. For studies with a sample size {\textgreater}300 the median annual incidence per 100,000 population was 10.5 (IQR 8.1-13.2) and the mean proportion of bilateral RRD was 7.26{\%}. Overall, the mean prevalence of lattice degeneration was 45.7+/-20.3{\%} and myopia was 47.28+/-12.59{\%}. CONCLUSIONS Estimates of RRD incidence have varied threefold, but inclusion criteria and other design features have differed across studies making direct comparisons difficult. The overall incidence of RRD is not yet well established: more incidence studies of adequate methodology are needed to explore temporal changes in incidence. RRD incidence varies with ethnicity and is strongly associated with increasing age, myopia and certain vitreo-retinal degenerations. Due to changes in cataract surgery trends, the proportion of pseudophakic RRD presenting to specialised centres appears to be increasing.},

abstract = {The highly hydrated, almost acellular vitreous body of the human eye consists of only 0.1{\%} macromolecules, of which collagens are the most important for its matrix structure. During embryological development, the human vitreous body is a highly dynamic matrix, in which the primary (vascular) vitreous is gradually replaced by the secondary (avascular) vitreous. With aging, the human vitreous undergoes a slowly progressive remodelling, characterized by the gradual formation of collagenous condensations and liquefied spaces in the gel structure. The former is probably the result of collagen synthesis and the deposition of newly formed collagen into the matrix, while the latter is probably due to collagen breakdown. Therefore, remodelling of the vitreous matrix starts at a very early age and continues into old age, albeit at a slower pace. Older theories and concepts of a strict spatial separation between the primary and secondary vitreous during embryonic development, and morphological changes in the aging vitreous being due to a simple aggregation of collagen fibrils are questioned. This review describes the embryological and postnatal remodelling of the human vitreous matrix and vitreoretinal interface, in addition to the mechanisms and cells that are potentially involved in this process.},

In addition, type VII increased in density and in distribution over the retinal layers toward the posterior pole.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Staining patterns of collagen types I to V, IX, XI, and XVIII confirmed previous observations. Important new findings include the presence of type VI in the ILM and type VII in several layers of the retina. Both collagens can anchor matrix components, and type VI could be involved in vitreoretinal attachment.

abstract = {Changes in vitreous structure that occur with aging are important in the pathogenesis of vitreous liquefac- tion (synchisis senilis), vitreous detachment, and retinal dis- ease. Vitreous morphology was studied in 59 human eyes post-mortem using dark-field horizontal slit illumination of the entire dissected vitreous. In many individuals younger than 30 years, the vitreous was homogeneous in structure. Middle-aged individuals had macroscopic fibers in the cen- tral vitreous, which coursed anteroposteriorly and inserted into the vitreous base and the vitreous cortex, posteriorly. During senescence, the vitreous volume was reduced, the vitreous body was collapsed (syneresis), and the fibers were thickened, tortuous, and surrounded by liquid vitreous. This sequence of age-related changes probably results from a progressive reorganization of the hyaluronic acid and col- lagen molecular networks. Characterization of the molecu- lar events underlying these changes will elucidate the mech- anisms of the phenomena of synchisis, syneresis, and de- tachment, and may provide methods with which to prevent or induce vitreous detachment prophylactically.},

abstract = {During childhood the vitreous undergoes significant growth. A study (Larsen, 1971a) of 926 children showed that, on average, the length of the newborn human vitreous is 10.5 mm in the male and 10.2 mm in the female. By the age of 13 the axial length of the vitreous increases to 16.1 mm (male) and 15.6 mm (female). Fledelius (1976, 1982) used ultrasound to measure ocular dimensions in adolescent humans and found that, in the absence of changes in refractive status, growth from ages 10 to 18 results in a mean vitreous elongation of 0.35 mm. The emmetropoic adult vitreous is approximately 16.5 mm in length (Luyckx-Bacus and Weekers, 1966).},

The vitreous body long has been the most mysterious of all ocular structures, owing perhaps to its seeming simplicity. There have been few concerted, sustained efforts to unravel the mysteries of how the vitreous is composed and what role it plays in normal physiology. Over the years, however, many studies have produced independent findings concerning vitreous biochemistry, structure, and physiology. The Vitreous organizes these findings into a well-constructed compendium that not only addresses the most current scientific knowledge, but also reviews historical perspec­ tives in a manner that lends richness to the scope of the book. The first few chapters present an exhaustive, yet readable, review of the body of scientific data that have come from laboratories and researchers throughout the world. Extensive bibliographies direct interested readers further into specific aspects of the basic science of the vitreous. Chapter II: "Embryology" and Chapter IV: "Structure" present a novel organizational approach to assembling and presenting data in an integrated manner. Chapter V: "Functions" and Chapter VI: "Development and Aging" introduce fresh perspectives on the importance of the vitreous as some­ thing more than a vestigial space filler within the eye.},

abstract = {Age-related differences in vitreoretinal adhesion were investigated in 59 human eyes from donors aged from 33 weeks of gestation to 94 years with the use of dark-field and electron microscopy of whole vitreous. In all eyes from individuals aged 21 years or older, dissection of the retina off the vitreous resulted in cleavage between the vitreous cortex and the internal limiting lamina. However, in six (40{\%}) of 15 eyes from individuals aged 20 years or younger, the internal limiting lamina remained adherent to the vitreous cortex in an area that encompassed the macula, temporal arcades, and peripapillary posterior pole. Ultrastructural studies revealed inner portions of M{\"{u}}ller's cells that were attached to the posterior aspect of the internal limiting lamina. These results suggested that, in youth, there is adhesion between the vitreous cortex and internal limiting lamina that is stronger than M{\"{u}}ller's cell itself and is topographically more extensive than previously thought.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To promote understanding of the development of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in healthy eyes using optical coherence tomography (OCT). METHODS We studied 209 eyes of 209 healthy volunteers (165 men and 44 women; mean age, 52.3 years [range, 31-74 years]). In addition to biomicroscopy and ophthalmoscopy, OCT was performed to obtain high-resolution cross-sectional images of the vitreoretinal interface in the posterior fundus. RESULTS The condition of the posterior vitreoretinal interface was classified as 1 of 5 stages, according to biomicroscopic findings and OCT images relative to discrete linear signals indicating a detached posterior vitreous face: stage 0, no PVD (61 eyes [29.2{\%}]); stage 1, incomplete perifoveal PVD in up to 3 quadrants (100 eyes [47.8{\%}]); stage 2, incomplete perifoveal PVD in all quadrants, with residual attachment to the fovea and optic disc (26 eyes [12.4{\%}]); stage 3, incomplete PVD over the posterior pole, with residual attachment to the optic disc (4 eyes [1.9{\%}]); or stage 4, complete PVD identified with biomicroscopy, but not with OCT because of instrument limitations (18 eyes [8.6{\%}]). Stage 1, 2, and 3 incomplete PVD without subjective symptoms was not recognizable on contact lens biomicroscopy. There was a significant age-related progression in the condition of the vitreoretinal interface from stage 0 to stage 4. The superior quadrant was usually the initial site of incomplete PVD. CONCLUSIONS Optical coherence tomography demonstrates that healthy human eyes have incomplete or partial PVD beginning as early as the fourth decade of life. Age-related PVD occurs initially as a focal detachment in the perifovea of 1 quadrant, with persistent attachment to the fovea and optic nerve head, with a predilection for the superior quadrant. It extends its range slowly for years and eventually results in complete PVD, associated with release of vitreopapillary adhesion.},

@article{Wang_2003,
abstract = {PURPOSE To determine the width of the posterior vitreous base in human eyes of different ages and to clarify the nature of the postoral retinovitreous adhesion that underlies the development of juxtabasal retinal tears and retinal detachment after posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). METHODS The posterior limit of the vitreous base was delineated with indocyanine green after mechanical peeling of the postbasal vitreous cortex from the retina in 58 pairs of donor eyes. The area of residual retinovitreous adhesion was measured by image analysis. Scanning electron microscopy was performed on the undersurface (or retinal aspect) of the inner limiting lamina (ILL) after trypsin digestion of the peripheral retina. RESULTS An age-dependent increase in the anteroposterior dimension of the posterior vitreous base was revealed that became progressively wider in eyes of male donors than in those of female donors and in the nasal half compared with the temporal half of the globe. Ultrastructural studies showed progressive invasion of the innermost peripheral retina by bundles of collagen fibrils, initially in the form of characteristic braids splaying out beneath the ILL and eventually as a dense sublaminar mat in the elderly. The collagen fibrils penetrated the ILL through localized defects and intertwined with those in the basal gel. CONCLUSIONS With aging, the posterior border of the vitreous base migrates posteriorly so that an annular band of firm adhesion eventually straddles the ora serrata eccentrically. Intraretinal synthesis of collagen fibrils, their penetration of the ILL, and their splicing with cortical vitreous fibrils, underlie the slowly evolving retinovitreous adhesion.},

The weight srequired to peel away the retina over the tapetum lucidum region in 3 mm width strips ranged from 40-55 mg and in the pigmented region, from 75 to 150 mg. Proportionately higher weights were observed with wider strips of tissue. The energy required to separate the two layeres, using tissue strips of 3mm width, was calculated from recordings made on a tensiometer. These values were found to be 8.2 +/- 1.3 ergs/cm{\^{}}2 in the tapetum lucidum region and 18.8 +/- 1.8 ergs/cm{\^{}}2 in the pigmented region. For wider strips, the mean energy of the adhesion per unit area wa slightly higher. The attachment between the sensory retina and the underlying tissue in the ora serrata was found to be very strong; continued pulling resulted in stretching and ultimate tearing of the tissue without achieving an actual separation. The source of the adhesive forces in the pigmented and tapetum lucidum regions in discussed in terms of (a) anatomical relationships between the apecal process of the pigment epithelial cells and the outer segments and (b) the possible role of the acid mucopolysaecharides of the interstitial matrix.},

abstract = {To simulate traction by organized vitreous, the retina was peeled off pigment epithelium in strips of rabbit eye tissue at rates between 2 and 210 mm/min. At lower peeling rates (2 mm/min) the detachment between retina and pigment epithelium was smooth. At the highest rate (210 mm/min) the detachment was jerky and irregular and sometimes occurred between choroid and sclera. When the release was smooth, the force required to detach the retina was found to increase proportionally to the logarithm of the peeling rate. This relationship indicates that the retina is bonded to the pigment epithelium by a viscoelastic substance, probably mucopolysaccharides, located between the retina and pigment epithelium. The retina stretches during peeling. Elongation is greater at lower peeling rates; at higher rates, the retina stiffens and elongation is less pronounced.},

Sloio traction (0.2 to 0.8 mm. per minute) produced higher and larger retinal detachments and bigger tears in both types of experimental animals. Medium traction rates (8.5 and 21.5 mm. per minute) resulted in lower and smaller detachments and smaller retinal tears. Above these rates (42.5 to 425.0 mm. per minute), the choroid separated grossly from the sclera. The ratio of traction force and height of detachment was proportional to the logarithm of the traction speed for slow and medium traction speeds. Structural studies showed that the separation of the retina occurred mainly between the two layers, at a traction rate of 0.2 mm. per minute, and at a level of the pigment epithelium at the rate of 8.5 mm. per minute. The structural changes and the force requirements during retinal detachment by traction in vitro are explained on the basis of the rheologic properties of the cementing substance be- tween the retina and pigment epithelium.},
